## What It Does

- **Text and vision**: send text prompts with optional images to any Claude model
- **33 built-in templates**: pre-written instructions for popular AI video/image models (generation and editing)
- **Save your own templates**: create and reuse custom instruction sets
- **Execution history**: searchable log of every run with cost tracking, favorites, and one-click settings restore
- **Model selection**: auto-fetched from the Anthropic API
- **Extended thinking**: Claude's chain-of-thought reasoning with configurable budget
- **Cost tracking**: token usage and USD cost after every run
- **Live API status**: colored dot in the footer shows Claude API health in real time
- **Seed-based caching**: fixed seed reuses the cached response, randomize forces a new one
- **API error recovery**: if the API key is missing or invalid, a modal lets you paste a new key and retry without restarting
